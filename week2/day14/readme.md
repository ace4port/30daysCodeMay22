# Day 14 | 30 Days Projects Showoff | 30 Days Challenge May 2022

## Intro
We have been working hard for the last 2 weeks and are almost halfway through the challenge.
Time to show the rest of the world what we have done and worked on.

Let us make a showoff page where you display all projects in one place.
Yes, GitHub is great but non-developers aren't particularly keen on it.

Thus this will be a place you can link anyone to and they will be able to view your hard work.

## Why 
This will serve as a future reference to yourself and for anyone you wish to brag about what you worked hard on.

## How
Let us make cards which link to projects for each day.


Let us start with project cards which link to projects for each day.
After the card is done, prepare a json and link all your projects link in one place.


Good luck!

Addidtional Challenges:
Make a div with text that appears on hover

This is kinda different- so more of research. Check if you can find a way to bring your readme.md of GitHub and style it. This might be a chalenge for another day. 

For image screenshot - Win + Shift + S on windows will allow you to take  screenshots

Sample project 
{
day: 10,
title: ‘Pomodoro Clock’,
