# Sample structure for challenge

# Title: Card

## Intro
Card is an essentail portion of web development. It is so fundamental that most styling libraries have dedicated api just for styling and configuring cards.

Cards can be of many shapes and forms- from social media post card(Facebook, reddit, insta), image, products in e-commerce, 
to blog post intro you can find use of cards everythere.

## Why 
We are starting out small. Initailly it is important to ensure that everyone is aligned correctly and we all get started at same place.
Also how I plan to proceed is to make components that will help us in future projects (major one) so week 1 we will be focusing on basic stuff mostly. 
However, if you are feeling particularly ambitious, there will be bonus challenges as well as ways to expand on this concept- so you can make it your own.

## What
You will be making simple card component. If you succeed, make a variant and play around further with styling things (border radius, background color, shadows).
Go wild and this is one where you are encouraged to research further and be creative.
Good luck!

## How- Specifications
Make any 2 simple card variants. Feel free to try out others but only 2 is required.
1. Simple blog post with image
2. Simple product display
3. Simple social media post
4. Card with multiple cta (call to action) or links
5. Card with header and footer
6. Music player card
7. Cover image card (nextui)
8. Thumbnail card (YouTube video card)


## User story
Here will be description of things you can do with each card. For this particular one, it is long and different but in future it will be very specific 
and detailed.


## Optimizing 
- Experiment around changing stylings and see if you can find and replicate card at other places on the internet 
- Make each card reusable with passing different data 


## Similar alternatives
Grid, Container

## Expanding further on the concept
What more can be done - to polish the concepts, add features etc

## Key takeaways
Starting out small we made a simple yet very powerful component.
Hope you succeeded in making it a reusable thing so you can use it in future projects!
Good job on the first task.
